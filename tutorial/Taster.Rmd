## Welcome

Hello everyone! This tutorial was created by [R Girls School Network](https://r-girls.github.io/website/) to promote the use of R in secondary schools for girls.

### How does this tutorial work?

You don’t need to install R/RStudio locally to run these lessons. These interactive lessons rely on the [learnr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) to create interactive code chunks, where we will run, edit, or write our own code. An example is shown below with some pre-populated code.

Give it a try and click the 'Run Code' button in the top right to see the outcome of this code to make a ggplot graph!

```{r demo-1, exercise = TRUE}
mpg$class = with(mpg, reorder(class, hwy, median))
p <- mpg %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + 
    geom_violin() +
    xlab("class") +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    xlab("")
  p
```

There will be occasions where you will be asked to “fill in the blanks” for practice but there is also a “Hint” and/or “Solution” button - in case you get stuck. You can find the hint or solution by clicking on that button. Go ahead and try it below, where you are asked to **update the point color to "orange" and the point size to 4** in this ggplot graph:

```{r demo-2, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r demo-2-hint}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "______", size = _)
```

```{r demo-2-solution}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange", size = 4)
```

## What we will learn?

Before we start the lesson, type your name where it says "write your
name here" on line 3. Make sure you type between the speech marks.

Knit the file. Can you see your name at the top of the output file?
Close the output file by clicking on the X

### Lesson Objectives

- To read in results from a .csv file
- To present results from the ruler drop test as boxplots
- To understand how information is stored in a dataset

### Success Criteria:

- I can draw a boxplot of my results
- I can draw boxplots for class results
- I have learnt the meaning of some programming terms

### Keywords:

- *variable* 
- dataset 
- *chr* 
- dbl

You should be familiar with how to draw boxplots in R from the previous
boxplot lesson

In this lesson, you are going to visualise the results from the ruler
drop test by drawing boxplots of:

-  Your reaction times before and after drinking coke
-  The mean before and after reaction times for the class

The results from the experiment are in a file called reaction_time.csv


## Let's Play!

First, click on the Files tab in the bottom right pane and check that
reaction_time.csv is listed. This is where all the results from the
investigation are recorded.

To read in our data, we will read them from `RGirls` package by calling `reactionData`.

```{r dara, exercise = TRUE}
reactionData
```

Make sure to run the code in read_data chunk by pressing the green arrow
pointing to the right.

This line of code will read in our reaction time dataset and save it as
a variable called `reaction_time`.
